This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

## Notes

0. Setup a next.js project (never really used next js, not convinced about all those script tags though)
1. Think of existing flows and sketch idea on paper
2. Fetch api data
